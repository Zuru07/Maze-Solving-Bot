# Maze Solving Bot

A smart bot built using the L298N motor driver, three ultrasonic sensors, and a Proportional (P) controller to navigate and solve mazes autonomously.

## Features

- Autonomous maze navigation
- Ultrasonic sensing in three directions (front, left, right)
- Proportional control-based wall following
- Real-time decision making based on obstacle distances
- Precise 90Â° turning at maze corners
- Modular and extendable codebase for PID control

## Wiring Overview

**Motors:**
- Left Motor: IN1 (GPIO 27), IN2 (GPIO 26), EN (GPIO 14)
- Right Motor: IN1 (GPIO 33), IN2 (GPIO 32), EN (GPIO 25)

**Ultrasonic Sensors:**
- Front Sensor: TRIG (GPIO 19), ECHO (GPIO 18)
- Left Sensor: TRIG (GPIO 5), ECHO (GPIO 4)
- Right Sensor: TRIG (GPIO 23), ECHO (GPIO 22)

## How It Works

### Initialization
- The setup function configures all motor and sensor pins.
- Serial communication is enabled for monitoring sensor readings.

### Obstacle Detection
- The front ultrasonic sensor continuously checks for walls.
- If an obstacle is detected within a predefined threshold:
  - The bot stops and checks left and right distances.
  - It then turns towards the direction with more space.

### Forward Movement
- If the front is clear, the bot moves forward.
- Optionally, the bot can use a proportional controller (P-controller) for more stable wall following using left and right sensors.

### Proportional Control (Optional)
- Uses the error between left and right wall distances.
- Applies a correction factor to adjust motor speeds.
- Designed to keep the bot centered between walls.

## Movement Functions

| Function        | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| moveForward     | Drives both motors forward           |
| stopMotors      | Stops both motors                    |
| turnLeft        | Turns the bot 90 degrees left        |
| turnRight       | Turns the bot 90 degrees right       |
| readDistance    | Reads distance using a sensor pair   |
